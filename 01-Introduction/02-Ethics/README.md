# Basic Definition
> The word "ethics" comes from the Greek word "ethikos" (and its root "ethos") meaning character or moral nature.

**Ethics** is about the shared values and moral principles that govern our behavior in society. Ethics is based not on laws but on 
widely accepted norms of what is "right vs. wrong". However, ethical considerations can influence corporate governance initiatives and government regulations 
that create more incentives for compliance.


- **Data Ethics** is a new branch of ethics that "studies and evaluates moral problems related to data, algorithms and corresponding practices". Here, "data" focuses 
on actions related to generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing, and usage, "algorithms" focuses on AI, agents, machine learning, and robots, 
and "practices" focuses on topics like responsible innovation, programming, hacking, and ethics codes.
___
- **Applied Ethics** is the practical application of moral considerations. It's the process of actively investigating ethical issues in the context of real-world actions, 
products and processes, and taking corrective measures to make that these remain aligned with our defined ethical values.
___
- **Ethics Culture** is about operationalizing applied ethics to make sure that our ethical principles and practices are adopted in a consistent and scalable manner across the 
entire organization. Successful ethics cultures define organization-wide ethical principles, provide meaningful incentives for compliance, and reinforce ethics norms by encouraging
and amplifying desired behaviors at every level of the organization.

# Ethics Concepts
## *1.Ethics Principles*

Every data ethics strategy begins by defining ethical principles - the "shared values" that describe acceptable behaviors, and guide compliant actions, in our data & AI projects.
You can define these at an individual or team level. However, most large organizations outline these in an ethical AI mission statement or framework that is defined at corporate levels 
and enforced consistently across all teams.

*Example: Microsoft's Responsible AI mission statement reads: "We are committed to the advancement of AI-driven by ethical principles that put people first" - identifying 6 ethical principles in the framework below:*

Let's briefly explore these principles. Transparency and accountability are foundational values that other principles built upon - so let's begin there:

- **Accountability** makes practitioners responsible for their data & AI operations, and compliance with these ethical principles.
- **Transparency** ensures that data and AI actions are understandable (interpretable) to users, explaining the what and why behind decisions.
- **Fairness** - focuses on ensuring AI treats all people fairly, addressing any systemic or implicit socio-technical biases in data and systems.
- **Reliability & Safety** - ensures that AI behaves consistently with defined values, minimizing potential harms or unintended consequences.
- **Privacy & Security** - is about understanding data lineage, and providing data privacy and related protections to users.
- **Inclusiveness** - is about designing AI solutions with intention, adapting them to meet a broad range of human needs & capabilities.
