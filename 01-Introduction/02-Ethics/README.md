# Basic Definition
> The word "ethics" comes from the Greek word "ethikos" (and its root "ethos") meaning character or moral nature.

**Ethics** is about the shared values and moral principles that govern our behavior in society. Ethics is based not on laws but on 
widely accepted norms of what is "right vs. wrong". However, ethical considerations can influence corporate governance initiatives and government regulations 
that create more incentives for compliance.


- **Data Ethics** is a new branch of ethics that "studies and evaluates moral problems related to data, algorithms and corresponding practices". Here, "data" focuses 
on actions related to generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing, and usage, "algorithms" focuses on AI, agents, machine learning, and robots, 
and "practices" focuses on topics like responsible innovation, programming, hacking, and ethics codes.
___
- **Applied Ethics** is the practical application of moral considerations. It's the process of actively investigating ethical issues in the context of real-world actions, 
products and processes, and taking corrective measures to make that these remain aligned with our defined ethical values.
___
- **Ethics Culture** is about operationalizing applied ethics to make sure that our ethical principles and practices are adopted in a consistent and scalable manner across the 
entire organization. Successful ethics cultures define organization-wide ethical principles, provide meaningful incentives for compliance, and reinforce ethics norms by encouraging
and amplifying desired behaviors at every level of the organization.
